# Diet Tracker

This is a personal diet tracking application built in Python. It logs weekly metrics, meals, activity data, and emotional reflections to support metabolic discipline and long-term health transformation.

## Features

- Add weekly entries with weight, body fat %, BMI, BMR, visceral fat, muscle mass, bone mass, protein %, water %, and skeletal muscle.
- Log meals with macro breakdowns (calories, protein)
- Track physical activity (miles walked, length of time walked, calories burned, average heart rate, and steps)
- Record emotional reflections for each day
- Future plans: CSV export, average rate calculations, and real-time summaries

## Why I Built This

This project reflects my own journey through VLCD compliance, metabolic recovery, and emotional clarity. It’s not just code—it’s a living artifact of discipline, frustration, and growth. I built it from scratch to learn how to structure Python programs and apply them to real-world routines.

## Status

Currently in development. Core data entry functions are being scaffolded. Future features will include summary analytics and file output.

## Data Sources

All metrics and activity data are recorded using real-world tools:

- **BeWell Scale**: Used for weekly body composition metrics including weight, body fat %, visceral fat, muscle mass, bone mass, and more.
- **Samsung Galaxy Watch6**: Used to track daily walks, including distance, duration, average heart rate, calories burned, and step count.

These devices provide consistent, structured data that feeds into the tracker. The program is designed to be flexible—users can adapt it to their own gear and measurement routines.

## How to Use

Run the program in terminal and follow the prompts to enter daily data. All entries are stored in memory or written to file (depending on version).

Built with sweat, discipline, and a few broken egg yolks.
