# Diet Tracker

This is a personal diet tracking application built in Python. It logs daily metrics, meals, activity data, and emotional reflections to support metabolic discipline and long-term health transformation.

## Features

- Add daily entries with weight, body fat %, visceral fat, and muscle mass
- Log meals with macro breakdowns (calories, protein, fat)
- Track physical activity (miles walked, calories burned, heart rate)
- Record emotional reflections for each day
- Future plans: CSV export, average rate calculations, and real-time summaries

## Why I Built This

This project reflects my own journey through VLCD compliance, metabolic recovery, and emotional clarity. It’s not just code—it’s a living artifact of discipline, frustration, and growth. I built it from scratch to learn how to structure Python programs and apply them to real-world routines.

## Status

Currently in development. Core data entry functions are being scaffolded. Future features will include summary analytics and file output.

## How to Use

Run the program in terminal and follow the prompts to enter daily data. All entries are stored in memory or written to file (depending on version).

Built with sweat, discipline, and a few broken yolks.
